<div class=WordSection1 style='width:60%;margin:auto'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Robbie Tucker</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>SPATS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Two-toned
spearmint green and peppermint white, like Chiclets gum when they still came in
colors, my 1955 Buick Roadmaster was a remarkable car.  The Cadillac of its
day, with an original price tag of $5,000, it was packed full of luxuries still
be hard to beat: a Wonderbar radio with a foot attachment for the driver. 
Pressing the Wonderbar engaged a small electric motor which moved the tuner
knob to the next AM signal.  If you didn’t like the song, press to go to the
next station or use your foot while keeping both hands on the wheel.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It had automatic
windows with master control for the driver, and an electric antenna that could
be raised or lowered from inside the car.  The etched chrome dashboard with
tiny patterns of swirls would have mesmerized M.C. Escher.  A light indicator
rested on its silvery, art deco surface that glowed like a faceted red jewel
when the emergency brake was on.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The Roadmaster had
Dynaflow, an automatic transmission developed and <span lang=EN>trademarked by
General Motors’ Buick Division between the late 1940s to the mid 1960s.  It was
known for its smooth (no lurching) take-off when you stepped on the gas.  T</span>he
back seat was like a living room couch; I could stick my legs all the way out
without my feet touching the seat in front.  And the green and white upholstery
with a woven boomerang pattern repeated the color scheme.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eight years
earlier, I had lost my virginity at fifteen, leaving me with an unfulfilled adolescent
fantasy: making out in the back seat of a car.  My new wheels fueled the allure
of all that teenage-ness.  And, of course, if you were going to fantasize about
having sex in the back of a car, it needed to be with a complete stranger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            I had
never purchased my own car before; I’d inherit ones my father was finished
with.  They were lemons: a Corvair Manza, a Chevy Vega.  When I found the ad in
the paper for the Buick, it sounded too good to be true, and my mechanic friend
Joe agreed, offering to drive me to San Rafael and check under the hood. Joe
looked like an overgrown Frank Zappa, with his dark coloring and soul patch
whiskers known as a Cadillac. At six-foot-five with a hefty girth, his
soft-spoken manner was oxymoronic.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN>            We
headed north to see the car in Marin County across the Golden Gate Bridge.  The
owner lived on the Dawn Horse Commune, a religious sect founded by cult-leader
Bubba Free John who was later sued for brainwashing, false imprisonment,
involuntary servitude and sexual harassment.  The car had been garaged by the
owner's parents, and Joe thought it was in exceptional shape with only 30,000
original miles.  “Girl, you need to buy this car,” he enthused after careful
inspection.  The purchase price was non-negotiable, but at $550 it was
manageable.  I drove it home behind Joe’s lead, marveling at how the view
looked even more spectacular through its massive windshield.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Christmas of 1976 followed
a couple weeks later, and my friend Tim had a party.  It was a small gathering
with mostly close friends, but a good looking guy I’d never met was there by
himself.  Clint was tall, muscular, and blond, with a cleft chin in his square
jaw, and handsome, chiseled features.  His girlfriend Lena was much older than
any of us, probably in her forties.  She worked at the post office on the late
shift, probably working that very night.  “They’re usually on the rocks,” Tim
said, when I asked him about the couple.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“Can I have a ride
in it?&quot; Clint asked when he heard about my Buick.  &quot;Please take me
somewhere, anywhere in that car.  How about tonight?” he pleaded.  His flirting
was unapologetic.  We left the party and stopped at a neighborhood bar, an art
deco lounge turned dive.  “They have a pretty swell jukebox here,” he said,
while he held the door for me.  We sat in a cozy booth and ordered drinks,
laughing easily like we’d known each other for years.  I detected a hint of
arrogance as he selected some Motown tunes, but I didn't really mind.  The
night was too full of promise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Back in the car, he sat
really close and suggested we drive to sightseeing favorite, Twin Peaks: two
breast-shaped mounds overlooking the city from around 900 feet.  Then he
playfully stuck his tongue in my ear, as I tried to stay focused on the road
without swerving.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            We parked on a narrow,
residential road divided by tall bushes on a tiny strip of land; then we moved
to the back seat.  Since Clint was tall we had to open the door from time to
time so he could stick his feet out; but it couldn’t be for long because the inner
light would stay on and we didn’t want to attract attention.  It was around
three in the morning, and I loved how the windows were getting steamed up. All
the houses along the road had Christmas lights on, and I wondered if they
hadn’t been twinkling extra over what was happening in the car.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I drove him to
Lena's around seven in the morning; she would be home from work soon.  We
agreed to meet again, some other time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>            Clint had
his own place in Berkeley, east across the Bay Bridge from the city.  His
apartment was sparse: highly-polished hardwood floors, clean white walls and
minimal furnishings.  There was nothing decorative other than photos of Greek
ruins. It was Spartan, like Clint, a Greek History student at UC Berkeley.  I
noticed him gazing at his reflection with a narcissistic once-over you'd expect
from a young Greek god.  We stayed in that night, and while we lay on the couch
in the candle lit room he told me that my belly looked like vanilla ice cream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In the morning he
was agitated.  “I don’t think we should see each other again,” he said abruptly,
breaking a silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“Oh?” I replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“You know,
school.  I need to focus more.  And then there’s Lena,” he went on, making
excuses.  “I like you.  You’re a really fun person.  But I don’t see this going
anywhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“Yeah, I don’t
either.  What would be the point?”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            There was so much fog
that morning it looked like the Bay Bridge had fallen off, and the thick, gray
mist was shrouding Avalon instead of San Francisco.  Being a little scared I
took a deep breath, drove slowly towards the taillights of the car ahead and
trusted that I’d find my way.  My thoughts wandered to a purchase of wide
whitewalls for the car; they’d make the tires look like they were wearing
spats. </p>
