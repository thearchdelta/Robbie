                        She is that rare blend of editing with a keen ear to what the writer is trying to do. She cares
                        about the work. She cares about authenticity, checking facts. She lets you know what she
                        experienced as a reader, which is important in assessing plot and characterization. She calls
                        with questions and invites lengthy discussion by phone.  She is a writer's dream.

Her feedback has been generous and highly constructive for my book and beyond.

She made the process exceptionally smooth, and I am certain my book is better for having been reviewed by her.

Her aesthetic is great, and she's able to articulate frankly and with tact as she collaborates with others. And her wry sense of humor comes in so handy as she dives into polishing a creative project. Robbie is one of the first colleagues to whom I send a link to weigh in on a current documentary-in-progress.
